# Distance

# Create a function named distance that takes two arguments: speed (km/h) and time (hours), both ints.
# This function should calculate the distance traveled using the speed and the time and return it in meters (int).
# No need to call the function (You can do it for testing purposes).

def distance(speed, time):
    return speed * time * 1000

print(distance(20, 3))
