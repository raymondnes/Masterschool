# Basic Arithmetic Operations

# Write a program that accepts two numbers and displays the results of their addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Prompt the user for two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the results
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Display the results
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {addition}")
print(f"The difference between {num1} and {num2} is {subtraction}")
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {multiplication}")
print(f"The quotient of {num1} divided by {num2} is {division}")
