Reverse a String
One interesting thing you can do with the step argument is to reverse a string. Try to figure out how, and write a function reverse_string(text) that takes a string text as an argument and prints the reversed string.

def reverse_string(text):
    # Your code here
    print(text[::-1])

# Call your function
reverse_string("Titanic")  # Should print: cinatiT
