# Loop Practice

# Write a program that accepts an integer n and prints the numbers from 1 to n.

# create a variable n that accepts int inputs from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# create a loop that iterates from 1 to the end of "n + 1"
for i in range(1, n + 1):  
        # print each number creaters by the variable i
        print(i)
